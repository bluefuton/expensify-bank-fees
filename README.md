# expensify-bank-fees
Generate a description and amount for Expensify bank fees. This is a tiny tool for Automatticians who submit expenses in USD and receive them in local currency.

## Installation

```
git clone git@github.com:bluefuton/expensify-bank-fees.git
cd expensify-bank-fees
npm install
```

## Usage

```
./bin/index.js
```

You will be prompted for a report title (e.g. "April expenses"), the expensed amount in USD and the amount you actually received in USD. You will have to do the currency conversion yourself for the moment. ðŸ™‚

The script will generate a description you can use on your Expensify report, and tell you how much to expense.
